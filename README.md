Welcome and thank you for downloading my game!

Escape Protocol is a 2D-pixel art platformer where players navigate a futuristic city filled with drones, turrets, and obstacles. The goal is to traverse levels, overcome enemies, and progress through the storyline by solving platform puzzles and surviving intense combat encounters.

UNAVAILABLE FEATURES

Currently, the feature that is not working in the game is the continue game button on the start screen. 
When you play the game if you were to either press the restart button or go to the escape menu then go to the main menu and start a new game two players will appear onscreen. 

ADVICE

With the gameâ€™s settings, I know it can be confusing and it may take some fiddling to set each option correctly. Some of the options will look incorrect on your screen and that is to be expected please choose a different option that better suits your monitor.
